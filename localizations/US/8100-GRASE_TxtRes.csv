$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14000_00_mfa,,Maybe it’s a ghost?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14100_00_mfa,,Oh my! That’s way more interesting!

$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0700_00_mfa,,"Oh, you can smell the flowers from here today!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0800_00_mfa,,Here’s to some wonderful encounters!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0900_00_mfa,,Moving to Kalm was the best decision ever~
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_1000_00_mfa,,I pray these peaceful days keep going forever.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_2100_00_mma,,"Hmmm, hmhmm~"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_3800_00_mfa,,Broden from the inn doesn’t look so good.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_3900_00_mfa,,Heard he’s been under the weather lately.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4000_00_mfa,,"You were a fan of his, right? Said his lonely smile was charming or something."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4100_00_mfa,,"Oh, keep that a secret from my husband!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4400_00_mma,,"So, how was the Midgar scene? Did you hit up the Honeybee Inn like usual?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4500_00_mma,,"Man, what a stage! That blonde dancer’s moves were razor-sharp."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4600_00_mma,,Ended up cross-dressing and sneaking into Corneo’s mansion.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4610_00_mma,,Wonder what’s going on there now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4619_00_mma,,Rumors say war might break out—what’re we gonna do?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4620_00_mma,,Cancel the Honeybee Inn tour?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4621_00_mma,,"Nah, times like this are when the girls give us strength!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4622_00_mma,,Hope that cross-dressing dancer’s still around.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4700_00_mfa,,"Come on, make those pretty flowers bloom!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4800_00_mfa,,"Ahh, what a nice scent."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5200_00_mma,,"Hmm, what’s up with those black cloaks?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5300_00_mma,,Is Shinra’s dark side behind it?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5400_00_mma,,I’m a writer tracking the black cloaks.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5500_00_mma,,"Most say they’re severe Mako poisoning cases, but some think they’re victims of special experiments."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5600_00_mma,,Feels like there’s more secrets to uncover. Gonna gather evidence and dig deeper.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5700_00_mma,,Making an enemy of Shinra could get messy.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6000_00_mma,,Fluffy steamed buns with sweet-and-spicy minced meat—so good!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6100_00_mma,,Leaving Midgar’s a bummer since I can’t grab Sector 8 steamed buns whenever I want anymore.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6200_00_mma,,"Ahh, that steamed buns girl vendor—my little steamed buns sweetheart!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6210_00_mma,,Wonder how she’s doing now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6300_00_mfa,,"If we picked flowers from the hill overlooking Midgar for this flowerbed, it’d look even prettier, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6500_00_mfa,,"Red, blue, yellow all lined up—with some green cat grass too!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6600_00_mfa,,It’d make a nice accent for sure!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7000_00_mfa,,"Hey, heard about Broden from the inn? They say he’s gone missing!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7100_00_mfa,,He wasn’t feeling well—maybe he went off to recover somewhere?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7200_00_mfa,,"Aw, not seeing Broad’s smile anymore—one of my little joys is gone."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0100_00_mma,,Got punched by a soldier. This bruise is Avalanche’s fault!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0200_00_mma,,They say Kalm’s Mako tank’s in trouble ’cause of the reactor explosion.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0300_00_mma,,Shinra’s army ain’t messin’ around—they showed us what they’ve got!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0310_00_mma,,Rumors of war with Wutai might actually come true.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0400_00_mma,,Midgar really got trashed—that for real?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0500_00_mma,,"Thanks to Avalanche, life’s gonna get tougher for us too."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0600_00_mfa,,"If Kalm stops getting Mako, we’re done for!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0700_00_mfa,,Looks like Midgar’s locked down for a while.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0800_00_mfa,,Getting hit by Shinra before Avalanche even gets here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0900_00_mfa,,War with Wutai—could that really happen?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10000_00_mfa,,Avalanche’s violence is a warning from the planet! The tornado that kicked up is proof of its anger!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_1000_00_mfa,,The plate falling—how many people got caught up in that?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10100_00_mfa,,"Mako is the planet’s life. If it runs dry, our lives will dry up too eventually."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10200_00_mfa,,We mustn’t let the Lifestream fade! May our lives be one with the planet!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2100_00_mma,,Kalm’s under strict alert right now. Keep stops to the bare minimum!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2200_00_mma,,Finish your business and get outta here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2500_00_mma,,Monster alert in effect—high priority!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2510_00_mma,,Airship noise has the monsters all riled up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2600_00_mma,,Don’t get close and throw your life away!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2900_00_mfa,,Getting nabbed by Shinra troops during a date—worst day ever!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3000_00_mma,,"But it got your heart racing, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3100_00_mfa,,"Yeah, seeing you get punched was the best!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_3400_00_mma,,"Thanks, Avalanche—you spiced up our date!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7200_00_mma,,"Oh yeah, I saw some black cloaks wandering the wastes near Midgar’s gate."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7300_00_mma,,They were moaning—gave me the creeps!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7400_00_mfa,,"Escaping Midgar, huh? Tough nuts, like sewer rats!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7500_00_mma,,"Haha, just like you guys!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8300_00_mfa,,"Hey, hey, what do Avalanche members look like?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8400_00_mma,,No info. Guess they don’t know much yet.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8500_00_mfa,,How’re we supposed to find ‘em then?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8600_00_mma,,Just turn in anyone who looks shady—that’s the plan!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8700_00_mfa,,"Oh, got it—should I report you then?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8800_00_mma,,"Phew, that was a close one!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8900_00_mma,,Nearly ran over some black cloaks on my way to Kalm!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9000_00_mfa,,That was a close call!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9100_00_mfa,,"Those guys are Mako addicts, right? Did Midgar kick ‘em out or something?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9200_00_mma,,They were walking in a group—pretty rare around here!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9800_00_mfa,,"People of the planet, hear its cries!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9900_00_mfa,,"The planet mourns, the planet sorrows, the planet rages!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0100_00_mma,,Avalanche is why the Mako’s drying up—I’ll catch ‘em myself!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0200_00_mma,,Shinra’s looking pretty rattled these days.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0300_00_mma,,"Avalanche or Shinra—whoever wins, we’re not cashing in."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0400_00_mma,,"If the Mako keeps dropping, Kalm’s gonna dry up too!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0500_00_mma,,Nobody told me Avalanche was in Kalm!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0600_00_mfa,,"The plate really fell, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0700_00_mfa,,Could Kalm have Avalanche collaborators too?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0800_00_mfa,,Mako’s running low—gotta start conserving now!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0900_00_mfa,,"Shinra’s capable of some scary stuff, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_1000_00_mfa,,Saw some black cloaks out in the Grasslands.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2100_00_mma,,"The Mako stopped coming, and the power just cut out!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2110_00_mma,,Fix it already!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2200_00_mma,,My fridge broke down too—it’s creaking like crazy! What gives?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2300_00_mma,,Mako pipes busted? When the hell are they fixing it?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2600_00_mfa,,"Hey, what’s going on? We’re barely getting any Mako here!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2700_00_mfa,,My washing machine’s dead—do something about it!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2800_00_mfa,,Hurry up and send some Mako already!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3100_00_mma,,"Finally fixed, huh? Back to normal life now."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3200_00_mma,,Big thanks to the repair crew!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3300_00_mma,,Hope this kinda thing doesn’t happen again!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3600_00_mfa,,It’s fixed now—but I wish they’d done it faster!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3700_00_mfa,,Gotta tackle all this piled-up laundry!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3800_00_mfa,,"Phew, the Mako’s finally flowing again!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4100_00_mfa,,"Shinra’s new president is the old President’s son, Rufus Shinra, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4200_00_mfa,,He’s still young—can he handle running a huge company?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4300_00_mfa,,"He’s young and hot, so he’ll be fine!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4400_00_mfa,,Though you don’t run a business with your face.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5100_00_mma,,Avalanche was right here in town—how’d I not notice?!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5200_00_mma,,"Next time they show up, we’ll take ‘em down ourselves!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5210_00_mma,,Protecting the reactor’s part of the Reactor Patrol’s job!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5900_00_mma,,"Held out through Shinra’s interrogations and waited—something good’s gotta come my way, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6000_00_mfa,,Look over there—they’re practicing the harvest festival dance!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6100_00_mfa,,"If I were a bit younger, I’d join in too!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6200_00_mma,,"Oh, it’s that time already?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6210_00_mma,,"Can’t do the wild dances anymore, but we could sway together nice and slow, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6300_00_mfa,,"Hehe, how many years has it been since I danced?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6310_00_mfa,,Not since we met at that Wall Market shop way back when.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7200_00_mmk,,Vroom vroom! Airships are so cool!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7300_00_mmk,,"Hiyah! Parachute squad, reporting in!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7400_00_mmk,,I wanna ride a real one someday! Gonna join Shinra’s army when I grow up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7500_00_mmk,,"Yeah, I’ll take down the bad guys!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7600_00_mfa,,"Ugh, Shinra showing up always makes me nervous."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7610_00_mfa,,Feels like we’re being watched—gross!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7700_00_mma,,"Yeah, those soldier helmets make me tense up even when I’m innocent!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7800_00_mfa,,But what if there’s a hot guy under that helmet?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7900_00_mma,,"Oh, that’d be a win~ Might even let him pat me down!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0700_00_mfa,,"Been a while, huh? Inviting me to lunch and all!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0800_00_mfa,,"So, how much you need to borrow today? Last time it was 300 gil."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0900_00_mma,,Uh...maybe 500 gil?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0910_00_mma,,That’d get me that MooMoo-chan I’ve been eyeing!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_1000_00_mfa,,"You’re hopeless, honestly!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2200_00_mmk,,Meow meow!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2300_00_mfk,,"No, no! Yelling like that will scare it away!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2400_00_mmk,,"Here, some food~!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2500_00_mfk,,That’s for the Chocobos!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2900_00_mfa,,Reactors make the land barren!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2910_00_mfa,,Kalm’s nature stays safe ’cause we don’t have a reactor!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3000_00_mfa,,"Ugh, here comes another lecture!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3100_00_mfa,,Maybe I should join Avalanche!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3200_00_mfa,,Every little action saves the planet—gets me fired up!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3300_00_mfa,,"Oh, come on! Mako’s already giving us a peaceful life—isn’t that enough?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3400_00_mma,,That guy’s no good—how about this one?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3500_00_mma,,"Hmm, doesn’t look like he’s got cash."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3800_00_mma,,Listen up—she gets off work at 7 p.m.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3810_00_mma,,And her favorite drink’s Land Pilsner.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3900_00_mma,,"Got it, master! I’ll ask her to the bar!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_4000_00_mma,,Go for it! Asking’s free—100 gil if you succeed!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_4100_00_mma,,50 fails in a row—any discounts?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_4200_00_mfa,,"Hehe, being cute’s a crime, huh?"
