$C1910_MAIN_0050_0100_00_red,,Where do I even start? What should I tell you?
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0200_00_red,,"The things I’ve seen with my own eyes, heard with my own ears, and felt in my heart."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0300_00_red,,"About the planet, about fate, about my comrades—all of it, I’ll share with you."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0400_00_red,,"The mako city, Midgar."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0500_00_red,,"The Shinra Company, dominating that massive city,"
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0600_00_red,,kept draining the Lifestream—the planet’s very lifeblood—and squandering it as mako energy.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0700_00_red,,"The planet was screaming in agony, but hardly anyone noticed its cries."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0800_00_red,,"Yet amidst it all, some rose to fight for the planet."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0810_00_red,,"The anti-Shinra group, Avalanche."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0900_00_red,,"They hired a mercenary—a man named Cloud, once a Shinra SOLDIER—and blew up Mako Reactor 1."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1000_00_red,,"In Sector 8, where the reactor’s destruction wreaked havoc, Cloud met Aerith, a flower seller."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1100_00_red,,She offered him a yellow flower.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1110_00_red,,Its meaning: <i>Reunion.</i>
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1200_00_red,,"From that moment, fate began to shift in a big way."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1300_00_red,,"Avalanche set their sights on blowing up Mako Reactor 5 next,"
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1400_00_red,,but it was all playing right into Shinra’s hands.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1410_00_red,,Shinra cunningly deceived and manipulated the people.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1500_00_red,,Avalanche ended up framed as the culprits behind the unprecedented disaster of Sector 7’s plate collapse.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1600_00_red,,"Losing precious comrades, with everyone crushed by despair, Aerith struck a deal with Shinra and let herself be captured."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1700_00_red,,"Aerith was the last surviving Cetra, a race once called the planet’s pioneers."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1800_00_red,,"Shinra sought the <i>Promised Land</i> from Cetra legend,"
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1900_00_red,,and they needed her power to find it.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2000_00_red,,Cloud and the others stormed the Shinra Building to rescue Aerith.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2100_00_red,,"I, held as an experimental specimen, joined them and helped free Aerith from the research lab."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2200_00_red,,"But then, the mightiest SOLDIER appeared before us."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2210_00_red,,"The legendary hero, Sephiroth."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2300_00_red,,Our long-dead nemesis stole Jenova’s remains—the origin of it all—kept in a secret lab.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2400_00_red,,"Escaping the Shinra Building, Cloud and the others raced down the highway, shaking off Shinra’s forces."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2500_00_red,,That old foe showed himself again.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2600_00_red,,"And then, an ear-piercing scream echoed out,"
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2700_00_red,,as the Feelers—guardians of fate—engulfed Midgar.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2800_00_red,,"Facing the wall of fate, Aerith spoke up."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2810_00_red,,"""This is where our paths diverge,"" she said."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2900_00_red,,We learned the road we’d walked so far had been protected by the Feelers.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3000_00_red,,And then—the moment of decision.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3100_00_red,,"Beyond that wall, we clashed with Sephiroth, who’d absorbed the guardians of fate."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3200_00_red,,"Carrying our comrades’ hopes, Cloud’s strike cut through destiny itself."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3300_00_red,,"The battle over, freed from fate’s rails, we left Midgar behind and stood in the uncharted wilds."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3400_00_red,,"And from here, a new journey begins—one no one has ever seen before—"
