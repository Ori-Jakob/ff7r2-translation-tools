$C1910_MAIN_0050_0100_00_red,,When there is so much to tell...<br>where should I even start?
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0200_00_red,,With all that we saw. What we heard. What we felt.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0300_00_red,,"This planet of ours. ""Destiny."" Our part in it.<br>Best to start at the beginning perhaps."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0400_00_red,,"Midgar, the City of Mako."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0500_00_red,,Ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company...
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0600_00_red,,"who drained the planet of its very essence, the lifestream, and processed it for industry as ""mako."""
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0700_00_red,,"Our world was dying,<br>and so few could hear her cries for mercy."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0800_00_red,,Those who could rose up in her defense.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0810_00_red,,The anti-Shinra rebels: Avalanche.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_0900_00_red,,"Among them, Cloud Strife─an ex-SOLDIER, hired by the resistance to destroy Reactor 1."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1000_00_red,,"In Sector 8, amidst the aftermath of the attack,<br>Cloud met a flower seller named Aerith."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1100_00_red,,She offered him a yellow blossom...
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1110_00_red,,"one said to symbolize ""reunion."""
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1200_00_red,,And thus was destiny set in motion.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1300_00_red,,"With Reactor 1 gone,<br>Avalanche set their sights on Mako Reactor 5."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1400_00_red,,Unfortunately...<br>they were playing right into Shinra's hands.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1410_00_red,,The company was able to draw<br>the wool over the peoples' eyes...
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1500_00_red,,"And in the end, destroyed Sector 7, killing thousands and laying the blame at Avalanche's feet."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1600_00_red,,"Though dear friends were lost, Avalanche had no time to grieve. Aerith had struck a deal with Shinra, who took her into custody."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1700_00_red,,"With her capture, Shinra's obsession was within reach─the fabled ""promised land."""
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1800_00_red,,For Aerith was the last of the Cetra─<br>the ancient stewards of the planet...
$C1910_MAIN_0050_1900_00_red,,and only she could guide them to paradise.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2000_00_red,,"To save her, the team infiltrated the Shinra Building─the company's beating heart."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2100_00_red,,"It was here that I─another prisoner─joined their story, and assisted them in freeing Aerith."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2200_00_red,,"Yet during our flight, we came face-to-face<br>with a man thought dead..."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2210_00_red,,The vaunted war hero Sephiroth.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2300_00_red,,"Before he could be stopped, Cloud's foe fled with the corpse of Jenova─the cataclysm from the stars, and the catalyst of our plight."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2400_00_red,,"Eventually we too made good our escape. Pursuing troopers defeated, we raced toward Midgar's edge..."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2500_00_red,,Yet Sephiroth once again intervened.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2600_00_red,,"Suddenly, deafening screams rent the air."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2700_00_red,,Whispers─the arbiters of fate─<br>descended upon the city.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2800_00_red,,"Before their imposing wall, Aerith warned us:"
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2810_00_red,,This was destiny's crossroads.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_2900_00_red,,"Every moment, every action, every step taken<br>had all been as the Whispers willed it."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3000_00_red,,To fight them was to break free.
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3100_00_red,,"On the other side of fate, Sephiroth waited,<br>the Whispers undulating within him."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3200_00_red,,"Cloud brought his blade down upon his rival,<br>sundering destiny."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3300_00_red,,"With the fight won, and the shackles of destiny broken, we stood before the unknown─a world of boundless freedom."
$C1910_MAIN_0050_3400_00_red,,"It was there, beyond where fate could follow,<br>that a new journey began."
