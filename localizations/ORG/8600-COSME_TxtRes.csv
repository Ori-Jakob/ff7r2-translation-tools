$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_11500_00_mfa,,The world might have too much negative energy floating around in it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_11600_00_mfa,,"You think we could, I dunno, use spiritual energy to put an end to war?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_11700_00_mfa,,"The planet will protect us from the ravages of war, right? Why wouldn't it?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_11800_00_mfa,,"If we wish to take good care of the planet, we should avoid war at all costs, right?"

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1200_00_mfa,,Our vale draws in people from all walks of life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12100_00_mma,,What's goin' on? Is somebody hurt?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12200_00_mma,,You see that robe?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12300_00_mma,,But...how did one of them make it all the way up <i>here</i>?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12400_00_mfa,,What happened? Is he okay?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12500_00_mfa,,I heard the people in black robes are suffering from some sort of illness.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12600_00_mfa,,They probably don't have much time left.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12700_00_mma,,Thanks for keeping watch over the vale.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12800_00_mfa,,My pleasure! Are you about to head out on patrol?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_12900_00_mma,,Yeah. Look after this place while we're gone.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13000_00_mfa,,I will. You be careful out there! And may the planet keep you safe.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1300_00_mfa,,Travelers are one of many blessings that are granted to us by the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13100_00_mfa,,I'm so glad you all made it out of there okay.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13200_00_mma,,Me too. I didn't think we'd run into the Gi...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13300_00_mma,,It seemed like they were bound by a deep hatred or sadness.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13400_00_mfa,,"There must be a reason for this, but what?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13500_00_mfa,,Sounds like Nanaki took care of those Gi. They won't be a problem anymore.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13600_00_mma,,Indeed. He's a true Watcher.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13700_00_mma,,"I suppose that means it's about time we resumed our patrols, then."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13800_00_mfa,,Of course. May the planet watch over you and keep you safe!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_13900_00_mma,,"We must live in harmony with our great mother, for the planet is an extension of us─and we of it."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14000_00_mma,,"As such, the life with which she has blessed us is a gift that must one day be returned."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1400_00_mfa,,All who call this planet home are family.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14100_00_mma,,"To nurture your spirit is to nurture the spirit of the planet. And so I implore you, brothers and sisters: do not neglect your studies, nor your prayers!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14200_00_mma,,"Through your diligence, you will find true fulfillment."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14300_00_mma,,Learn well the joys of giving.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14400_00_mma,,Generosity is a great virtue─one which the planet will reward in kind.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14500_00_mma,,We are not made lesser for it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14600_00_mma,,Our world is sustained by an unending cycle. All that passes from us shall one day return.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14700_00_mma,,Those who sacrifice shall be made whole.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14800_00_mma,,"We are siblings all, born of one mother."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14810_00_mma,,"With boundless love for her children, she serves as both cradle and crucible."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_14900_00_mma,,"When our journey ends and our return is ordained, we go as beings honed by lives well lived─a balm to the planet that ensures the cycle continues."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15000_00_mma,,It is for our mother─and for our brothers and sisters─that we render up our bodies and our souls.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1500_00_mfa,,"Our joy, our sorrows─they are the planet's too."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15100_00_mfa,,Put your faith in our great mother.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15200_00_mfa,,"She would never forsake us, never abandon us, for we are her children one and all."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15300_00_mfa,,This wonderful planet is always watching over us─ever keeping calamity at bay.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15400_00_mfa,,"If people everywhere resolved to not take her bounty for granted─and offered up prayers of gratitude─no man, woman, or child would suffer."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15500_00_mfa,,Hearken to the wisdom of the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15600_00_mfa,,"It is boundless and infinite, and we may share in it freely if we open ourselves to her."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15700_00_mfa,,"It is found within the soil beneath our feet, the trees from which it sprouts, the birds which nestle in their boughs."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15800_00_mfa,,"And when that life fades, it returns to the wellspring of all truths that is the beating heart of our mother."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_15900_00_mfa,,"If we've anything to fear, it is not our fellow man─nor any creature, big or small, with whom we share our home."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16000_00_mfa,,It is that which comes from beyond the confines of this world.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1600_00_mfa,,The planet is always watching over each and every one of us.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16100_00_mfa,,That which disrupts the natural order─the other which may attempt to claim and consume the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16200_00_mfa,,"And so I bid you, her children, to join hands and come together."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16210_00_mfa,,"For united, we shall never succumb to fear of celestial calamity."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16300_00_mma,,"I ask you this: who among you has looked inward, into the universe of the soul?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16400_00_mma,,"Just as each of us is a part of the planet, the planet is a part of us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16500_00_mma,,"Therefore, does it not follow that to heed the words of one's own heart, is in essence to heed the words of our great mother?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16600_00_mma,,Thus do I urge you to hearken to that voice─that of the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16700_00_mma,,Within you all are the planet's thoughts and memories.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16800_00_mma,,"By unlocking this knowledge, it allows us to heighten our spiritual potency."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_16900_00_mma,,"I invite you to do so now! Set free the secrets within, and lift yourselves higher!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17000_00_mfa,,Feel the energy all around you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1700_00_mfa,,Every day I give thanks to the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17100_00_mfa,,"It rides the winds across our planet, singing through the vale to fill our lungs, and by extension our very beings."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17200_00_mfa,,"As you'll come to learn, the practice of mindful breathing can connect us with the ineffable wonders of the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17300_00_mfa,,"Since time immemorial, these sacred lands have been rich in spiritual energy."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17400_00_mfa,,"To pass through the vale, and trace the whistling winds, is to reflect on the journey of life and our eventual return."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17500_00_mfa,,It is to understand the cycle that sustains us─the cycle of death and rebirth.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17600_00_mfa,,"Go forth, brothers and sisters. Lend an ear to the winds, and walk the path of discovery."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17700_00_mfa,,"What an upstanding young man you are, helping out like this. You deserve a nice reward."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17800_00_mmk,,"Thank you so much! Mom, look! I got some candy!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_17900_00_mfa,,"Oh, that's very kind! Thank you. Remember to say a prayer before you eat it!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18000_00_mmk,,I know.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1800_00_mfa,,Let me guess─the planet led you here?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18010_00_mmk,,"O great mother planet, thank you for this blessing."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18100_00_mfa,,That's my good little boy.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18200_00_mfa,,"Oh, hello. Heading out somewhere?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18300_00_mfa,,"Yes, actually. Wanted to make an offering to the planet. We had such a great harvest this year, I thought it only proper."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18400_00_mfa,,But enough about me. How are you doing?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18500_00_mfa,,"I'm fine, thank you. Baby's well too. I feel her getting stronger and stronger with every passing day."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18600_00_mfa,,"We've all been so blessed, haven't we? Praise be to our great mother."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18700_00_mmk,,"Hey, is Fellow Bugenhagen gonna come down today?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18800_00_mfk,,"Hmm, I dunno. The other day he said his back was hurting a lot."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_18900_00_mmk,,"Well, then he oughta come down and...get a massage!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19000_00_mfk,,"Oh, y'know what? My daddy said he was gonna go deliver Fellow Bugenhagen some food!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_1900_00_mma,,"Welcome, young traveler. Open your ears and hearken to the voice of the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19100_00_mfk,,Maybe we could go with him?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19200_00_mfa,,Can you believe it? Nanaki's back! It's such a relief to know that he's okay.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19300_00_mma,,"Did you see that scar over his eye, though? I don't know what he's been through, but it must've been bad."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19400_00_mfa,,"Still, he's home safe now, and we owe the planet a debt of gratitude for that. We should make an offering."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19500_00_mma,,"""Avalanche, wanted dead or alive""... They've certainly made a name for themselves, haven't they?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19600_00_mfa,,For themselves <i>and</i> for us.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19700_00_mfa,,"In the public's eyes, planetologists and Avalanche are one and the same."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19800_00_mma,,"Even so, I doubt we need to worry about Shinra up and attacking Cosmo Canyon unprovoked."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_19900_00_mma,,Though that <i>would</i> complicate my research.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20000_00_mma,,That windmill generates energy for us.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2000_00_mma,,Life is a wondrous gift from the planet─one that is precious and fleeting.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20100_00_mma,,"Its output pales in comparison to that of a mako reactor, but it's more than enough for the people of the vale."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20300_00_mma,,"It allows us to mill grain and power our survey teams' vehicles, among other things."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20400_00_mma,,"Every day, the amount produced gets divvied up to satisfy all our needs."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20500_00_mma,,"With Cosmo salt, you can add a dash of the planet's grace─and deliciousness─to anything you like!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20700_00_mma,,Blessings of the planet be upon your cooking with our one-of-a-kind seasoning!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_20800_00_mma,,"Step right up, folks!"

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21200_00_mma,,You won't find ruby cones or Cosmo cactuars anywhere but here! Better not miss out!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21300_00_mma,,Show your gratitude for the planet's gifts!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21400_00_mfa,,Come get a talisman infused with the powers of the planet!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21500_00_mfa,,"Buy one of these, and the souls of our ancestors will surely grant you good fortune!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21600_00_mfa,,These bags were made with our one-of-a-kind weaving technique!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21700_00_mfa,,All of our fabulous designs have been infused with prayers to the planet!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21800_00_mfa,,"We've got plumes, furs, and stones!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_21900_00_mfa,,All of the items we offer are handcrafted by the vale's most skilled artisans!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_22000_00_mfa,,Don't miss out on this chance to carry a blessing of the planet with you wherever you go!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2200_00_mma,,O great mother... Soon I will return to your bosom.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_22100_00_mfa,,"Come try our signature canyon candies and snacks! They're so good, they'll send your taste buds straight to the cosmos!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_22200_00_mfa,,Hankering to add some flavor to your visit? Take our snacks with you as you see the sights!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2300_00_mma,,"The energy coursing through the planet includes those who came before, and those who will come after."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2400_00_mfa,,Know this: to offer a prayer unto the planet is to join one's soul with it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2500_00_mfa,,"The planet─she speaks to us, each and every moment of our lives."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2600_00_mfa,,"Even though we may struggle to see it, everything with which the planet has blessed us has a purpose."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2700_00_mfa,,We must live our lives with gratitude in our hearts for the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2800_00_mfa,,"The planet's blessings are many, and we must take none for granted."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_2900_00_mma,,Today is a special day─one that only comes once a year.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3000_00_mma,,It must've been the planet's will that you made it to the canyon just in time.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3100_00_mma,,I believe you'll find the ceremony this evening to be quite engaging.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3200_00_mma,,The festival this evening may be of interest to you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3300_00_mma,,You're more than welcome to come watch the River of Lights.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3400_00_mfa,,The River of Lights is an important festival here in the vale.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3500_00_mfa,,"By the light of the festival, may the lost return home."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3600_00_mfa,,We're really looking forward to experiencing the River of Lights tonight.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3700_00_mfa,,The ceremony will begin after sundown.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3800_00_mfa,,O great mother... Light our way again tonight.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_3900_00_mma,,The vale pulses with energy today─more so than any other day of the year.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4000_00_mma,,The winds are favorable. This year's ceremony promises to be wonderful indeed.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4100_00_mma,,We spend the entirety of each year preparing for this special day.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4200_00_mma,,At least I'll be able to see the ceremony one last time.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4300_00_mfa,,You've come to the canyon on a very good day. This evening is the River of Lights.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4400_00_mfa,,"On this most sacred of nights, may the souls of the departed find peace in the planet's embrace."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4500_00_mfa,,It's as though the wind itself sings to us during the River of Lights.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4600_00_mfa,,"O great mother... Please, welcome your lost souls with love and grace."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4700_00_mma,,"One day, we shall be reunited with those who have returned to the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4800_00_mma,,It was quite the turnout tonight. I'm sure the departed would be pleased.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_4900_00_mma,,"The River of Lights was beautiful to behold, was it not?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5000_00_mfa,,"Eventually the day will come when we, too, are counted among that light."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5100_00_mfa,,Did you enjoy the ceremony? It's quite special.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5200_00_mfa,,"Weren't the lanterns beautiful? They were actually made by some of the local children, I hear."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5300_00_mma,,"Death is a sad-but-necessary affair, that we may be blessed with new life."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5400_00_mma,,My wife made it back to the planet. I can feel it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5500_00_mma,,The stars always shine that much brighter the night of the ceremony.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5600_00_mfa,,"For those who dwell upon the planet, there is no greater elation than to return to the great flow."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5700_00_mfa,,The life born of the planet is never without purpose. Every single soul serves the grand design.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5800_00_mfa,,"What we have been given, we must one day return. So it has always been, and so it shall ever be."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_5900_00_mma,,Are we not all brothers and sisters? What good could ever come from war?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6000_00_mma,,All any of us can do now is pray for peace.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6100_00_mma,,"War deprives us not only of life, but of culture and history. I pray this one does not reach the vale."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6200_00_mfa,,Are these differences truly so great that war is the only answer?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6300_00_mfa,,"At this rate, both Wutai and Shinra will be destroyed by their greed."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6400_00_mfa,,The planet would never want us to wage war on one another.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6500_00_mma,,None of us can claim the life that courses through the planet─for it is hers alone.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6600_00_mma,,Everyone returns to the planet one day. Why do we rush through our lives?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6700_00_mma,,O great mother... Guide your foolish children.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6800_00_mfa,,Whatever wrongs we inflict upon the planet will come back to haunt us in time. Such is the cycle.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_6900_00_mfa,,Please bring comfort to those in pain. Show them mercy.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7000_00_mfa,,O planet... Watch over us as we face the coming trials.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7100_00_mma,,"Wow, so <i>this</i> is Cosmo Canyon!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7200_00_mma,,Just being here makes my soul feel lighter!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7300_00_mma,,I can <i>feel</i> the spirituality!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7400_00_mma,,"Well now! Called here by the planet too, were ya?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7500_00_mma,,It feels like the cosmos is within me.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7600_00_mma,,I'm gonna become a whole new me here!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7700_00_mma,,Talk about a nice breeze.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7800_00_mfa,,Oh hell yeah! My soul feels rejuvenated already!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_7900_00_mfa,,This is definitely a spiritual hot spot if I ever saw one.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8000_00_mfa,,"C'mon, planet. Grant me good fortune!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8100_00_mfa,,"Okay, now this is what I call being in the great outdoors!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8200_00_mfa,,I wonder how high up we are right now.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8300_00_mfa,,I...I can't even. I have no words.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8400_00_mfa,,There are windmills <i>everywhere</i>.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8500_00_mma,,You'd be crazy to pass up a chance to see the River of Lights!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8600_00_mma,,Gotta kill some time before the ceremony.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8700_00_mma,,I came here to see the River of Lights tonight!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8800_00_mma,,"Man, I can't wait to see what they've got planned!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_8900_00_mma,,"The River of Lights, huh? Saw something about that in the brochure."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9000_00_mfa,,I can't wait for the River of Lights! I've heard so much about it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9100_00_mfa,,"Wow, so many tourists. Must be quite the festival."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9200_00_mfa,,Who should I ask to come with me to the River of Lights?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9300_00_mfa,,What kind of ceremony do you think the River of Lights is?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9400_00_mfa,,This River of Lights thing sounds so cool. I can't wait!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9500_00_mma,,We've all gotta return to the planet someday... You know?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9600_00_mma,,It's never too late to change...right?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9700_00_mma,,That ceremony gave me a lot to think about. Don't think I'll get much sleep tonight.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9800_00_mfa,,I think I need time to process how I feel about it all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0100_9900_00_mfa,,I've never seen anything so beautiful in my whole life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0100_00_mma,,Crazy to think these caves formed naturally. How does the planet even do that?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0200_00_mma,,"No matter where you stand, you can feel the breeze. It's really nice."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0300_00_mma,,"Pretty clever, the way they built everything around the caves like this."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0400_00_mfa,,It's so nice and cool in here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0500_00_mfa,,Watching the flames flicker on the dirt floor like this─it's such a vibe.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0600_00_mfa,,It must've taken eons to form this cave...and now we're standing in the middle of it!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_0700_00_sma,,"Tonics, liniments, philters─we have everything you need to cure what ails you."

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_1200_00_mfa,,They say that the owner of this shop invented the precursor to the modern potion.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_1300_00_mma,,A thirty-year-old potion? Wonder if it's still any good.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_1400_00_mfa,,"You heard of Phoenix Feces? Supposedly they're great for your health, but it looks like they're sold out."

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_1900_00_mma,,You ain't gettin' your hands on a proper weapon 'less the owner thinks you're the real deal.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2000_00_mfa,,"When in the vale, do as we do. Which means lay off the fighting."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2100_00_mma,,No visit to Cosmo Canyon's complete without pickin' up one of the replicas sold here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2200_00_mfa,,Our lives are gifts from the planet─instruments to serve her design.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2300_00_sfa,,The home of planetology is the perfect place to refine your abilities.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2300_00_sfa,ACTOR,Bookstore Employee
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2400_00_sfa,,The history of Maghnata Books can be traced back to Cosmo Canyon itself.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2400_00_sfa,ACTOR,Bookstore Employee
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2500_00_sfa,,May the planet bless you with wisdom.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2500_00_sfa,ACTOR,Bookstore Employee
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2600_00_sfa,,Our great mother's memories will always be here for you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2600_00_sfa,ACTOR,Bookstore Employee
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2700_00_mma,,I wonder if that book I special-ordered has come in yet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2800_00_mfa,,No other store has this many books dedicated to planetology. We're lucky to have it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2900_00_sma,,"Fwahhh... Oh, hey, wassup? Um, you a customer?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_2900_00_sma,ACTOR,Materia Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3000_00_sma,,"Er, uh, right─how can I be of service?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3000_00_sma,ACTOR,Materia Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3100_00_sma,,Fwahhh... Thanks for the business.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3100_00_sma,ACTOR,Materia Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3200_00_sma,,"Oh─and, uh...please come again!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3200_00_sma,ACTOR,Materia Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3300_00_mma,,Something about just looking at materia makes me feel centered.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3400_00_mfa,,The luminance of materia is the light of the very planet itself.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3500_00_mfa,,Stock up on whatever you need.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3500_00_mfa,ACTOR,Accessory Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3600_00_mfa,,Go on. Take a look around!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3600_00_mfa,ACTOR,Accessory Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3700_00_mfa,,Thanks. Hope to see you again soon!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3700_00_mfa,ACTOR,Accessory Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3800_00_mfa,,Thank you so much!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0200_3800_00_mfa,ACTOR,Accessory Vendor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0100_00_sma,,The starlit night is yours.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0100_00_sma,ACTOR,Innkeeper
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0200_00_sma,,May the cosmos above grant you a restful sleep.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0200_00_sma,ACTOR,Innkeeper
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0300_00_sma,,Go with the planet's blessings.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0300_00_sma,ACTOR,Innkeeper
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0400_00_sma,,"Pleasant dreams, I trust?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0400_00_sma,ACTOR,Innkeeper
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0500_00_mma,,"Welcome to the Syldra Inn, the canyon's famed cave hotel."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0600_00_mma,,Ours is the most storied establishment in the vale.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0700_00_mma,,"If you're wondering where the name ""Syldra"" comes from, it's a legendary dragon featured in local tales."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0800_00_mfa,,"We've hosted many noteworthy guests, including Professor Gast himself!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_0900_00_mfa,,It's said that these caves were formed from erosion caused by the lifestream itself.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1000_00_mfa,,May the planet grant you a deep and restorative slumber.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1100_00_mma,,So this is the famous cave hotel!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1200_00_mma,,I've been dyin' to come here ever since I read about this place in a guidebook!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1300_00_mma,,Wonder if they have to worry about leaky roofs here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1400_00_mfa,,It's so romantic! Makes me wish I hadn't come here by myself.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1500_00_mfa,,"That boulder's not gonna come tumbling down while we sleep, right?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1600_00_mfa,,"The ceiling's so high, it's like I'm sleeping out under the stars!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1700_00_mfa,,This place is divine! I can't believe you got a reservation!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1800_00_mma,,"But of course! Today's our anniversary, my love!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_1900_00_mma,,Whaddaya say we go and do some exploring later!?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2000_00_mfa,,Hah. You sound like a kid in a candy store.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2100_00_mfa,,"Come to think of it, this is the first time we've taken a trip together."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2200_00_mfa,,"Huh, you're right! Funny, considering how long we've been a couple."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2300_00_mma,,So the concert at the Royal Coast...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2400_00_mma,,"Think they pulled it off? I mean, you were their star pianist before we..."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2500_00_mma,,"I told you the person I got to sub for me would manage, didn't I?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2600_00_mma,,"More importantly, we need to commit to a house. Now, I thought the property we saw the other day was to die for."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2700_00_mma,,"It was, but don't you think it might be a little big for the two of us?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2800_00_mma,,"Well, it does need to have room for my piano. And who knows... Our family might end up growing someday."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_2900_00_mma,,"There's more than one way to nurture life, after all. Isn't that what we learned from our time here in Cosmo Canyon?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3000_00_mma,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. From now on, our life together can be whatever we want it to be."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3100_00_mma,,By the boundless grace of the planet may we enjoy our lives and this meal before us.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3200_00_mma,,"From our brethren are we given life, and unto them shall we give life in turn."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3300_00_mma,,We offer our thanks to the great mother for the pleasure of sharing her bounty with others.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3400_00_mma,,"Great mother, we thank you for your blessing."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3500_00_mma,,"Great mother, we thank you for your blessing."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3600_00_mfa,,"Great mother, we thank you for your blessing."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3700_00_mfa,,"Great mother, we thank you for your blessing."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3800_00_mma,,"These dabblers who visit the vale are students of planetology in name only. Vapid, shallow people─tourists."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_3900_00_mma,,"Well, some of them may have a genuine interest. Who can say for certain?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4000_00_mma,,They may even come to embrace the teachings!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4100_00_mma,,Doubtful. True planetological enlightenment shall forever elude their grasp.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4200_00_mma,,They cling to mako─and that is an addiction not easily shaken.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4300_00_mma,,Have you heard about Avalanche's crimes? There are wanted posters for them all over Cosmo Canyon.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4400_00_mfa,,"To think that such violence would be perpetrated under the banner of planetology. It turns my stomach, honestly."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4500_00_mma,,"Fellow Bugenhagen told us to leave them be, and this is what we get for our inaction."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4600_00_mma,,We should've done something when we had the chance.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4700_00_mfa,,There's no point lamenting choices made long ago.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0300_4800_00_mfa,,We must focus our efforts on the future─on ensuring that the canyon and the people here remain safe.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0100_00_mma,,All who seek to understand the tenets of planetology are welcome.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0200_00_mma,,I hope you learn as much as you can while you're here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0300_00_mma,,To study planetology is to learn how to live as one with the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0400_00_mma,,"So, what are your thoughts on the life force of the planet?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0500_00_mma,,"We need only open our hearts to the planet, and she will speak to us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0600_00_mma,,"Our bodies, our minds, our very souls─all these are gifts from the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0700_00_mma,,Devote yourself to our planet. Only then shall you know love and joy everlasting.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0800_00_mfa,,Welcome to planetology's house of learning.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_0900_00_mfa,,You're interested in learning more about planetology? That's wonderful.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10000_00_mfa,,I had no idea that planetology was this complicated.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1000_00_mfa,,May planetology ever illuminate your path through life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10100_00_mfa,,Wow! I can already feel myself becoming one with the planet!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10200_00_mma,,Is there any truth to the rumors? Has the beast really been sighted?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10300_00_mfa,,"If the survey team is to be believed, then...I'm afraid so."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10400_00_mma,,"The last sighting was only two years ago, though... The gaps are growing shorter and shorter."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10500_00_mfa,,Could it be a sign that something's wrong with the planet?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10600_00_mma,,Word is that Caesar recruited some people to look into that whole situation with the fiend.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10700_00_mfa,,I pray the falling stars light up the sky soon.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10800_00_mma,,All we can do now is wait for news.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_10900_00_mfa,,Have you heard? The falling stars have been sighted!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11000_00_mma,,"Indeed, it's wonderful! What's more, this affair has afforded us an opportunity to further our studies."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1100_00_mfa,,"Every day, we offer a diverse range of seminars for visitors."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11100_00_mma,,What an honor it is to bear witness to such an incredible event!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11200_00_mma,,Look at these rock formations.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11210_00_mma,,The erosion process must have started hundreds of millions of years ago.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11300_00_mma,,And those lines... They were caused by ancient lifestream currents?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11400_00_mma,,Indeed. Strata like these are a window into history.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11500_00_mma,,"Layers upon layers of rock and sediment, built up and worn down over countless millennia."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11600_00_mma,,An eternity compared to the brief moment that is a human life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11700_00_mma,,"Welcome, friend, to the Starlet pub."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11800_00_mma,,"If you're lookin' for a drink, the Torch is our biggest hit."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_11900_00_mma,,"I also recently came up with a new cocktail─""the Lifestream."" Care to try it?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12000_00_mma,,"For generations, this tavern has served as a place for us to debate planetological theories."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1200_00_mfa,,"At our very core, we are connected to the planet in ways that defy description."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12100_00_mma,,The vale has a history of brewing its own spirits. Some were even used in ceremonies at one point.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12200_00_mma,,"For many of us, the tavern is a home away from home."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12300_00_mma,,We have the planet to thank for these spirits too. Gotta consume 'em with the proper─<i>hrk</i>─reverence.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12400_00_mfa,,This is where all the students come to take a load off.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12500_00_mfa,,I still need to decide on a subject for my next seminar.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12600_00_mfa,,"I was just gonna take a little break until the next seminar, but... Hrk! Drank too much."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12700_00_mfa,,Nothing like a stiff drink to get the creative juices flowing.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12800_00_mma,,"""O wise ones! Gather at the bar and let your knowledge be shared!"" And so we have, for generations untold."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_12900_00_mma,,It's difficult to have a proper discussion with young people these days.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13000_00_mma,,Why don't we discuss our incredible planet over drinks?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1300_00_mfa,,The planet speaks to all of her children. No one is greater or lesser in her eyes.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13100_00_mfa,,May the conversations held here become the spark that rekindles hope for planetology and mankind.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13200_00_mfa,,I spent many an evening here engaged in vigorous debate─always with a Torch in hand!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13300_00_mfa,,Sometimes I think alcohol just might be the planet's greatest blessing of all!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13400_00_mma,,This liquor has an unmistakable aroma.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13500_00_mma,,"Love how they talk around here! ""Gather round, fellow planetologists!"""
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13600_00_mma,,Whoa... It's like the planet's floatin' right in front of me.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13700_00_mma,,To the blessings of the planet! Cheers!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13800_00_mma,,"Maybe I've had one too many, but I get the planet now."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_13900_00_mfa,,"Urgh... Ummm, what was the next seminar about again?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14000_00_mfa,,"Heh! You know, I could return to the planet right now and be completely satisfied."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1400_00_mfa,,"I've been studying planetology for years now, but there's always more for me to learn. Its depths are immeasurable."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14100_00_mfa,,This liquor has an herbal bouquet that's indescribable.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14300_00_mfa,,"If mako is the planet's lifeblood, then alcohol is <i>my</i> lifeblood!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14400_00_mma,,"Oh, Professor Gast. I hope you know that your legacy lives on─that your discoveries paved the way for our successes."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14500_00_mma,,What other scholar could ever hope to match your passion and excellence?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14600_00_mma,,Why did you have to leave us?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14700_00_mma,,Every day I strain to listen and pluck out your voice from the planet's chorus...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14800_00_mma,,"This variety of spirits is sacred, actually. In fact, it was originally brewed for ceremonial use!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_14900_00_mma,,Local flora make up the bulk of what's used to brew it─though the exact method for doing so is a closely guarded secret!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15000_00_mfa,,"My, aren't you well informed. Then you know about Cosmo salt? It's a special kind only found around here."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1500_00_mma,,Sorrow is not a burden─far from it. It is yet another of the planet's gifts.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15100_00_mfa,,A unique property of the local minerals causes it to take on a star-like shape when processed. It's really quite something.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15200_00_mma,,"If you ask me, planetology's the future! Mako's old news."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15300_00_mma,,I say we replace the stuff with wind power!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15400_00_mfa,,"Yeah, down with Shinra! We'd be so much better off without them!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15500_00_mfa,,"You can't talk like that, at least not in public. What if people start thinking you're with Avalanche?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15600_00_mma,,A seminar is in progress. Please be respectful.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15700_00_mma,,There is no seminar being held here at the moment.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15800_00_mma,,Can I help you?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15900_00_mma,,"Now then, who would like to speak next?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_15900_00_mma,ACTOR,Mentor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16000_00_mma,,Very well. Let us have our next speaker share their words with us.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16000_00_mma,ACTOR,Mentor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1600_00_mma,,"To study planetology is to seek to know our planet─and by extension, to know ourselves."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16100_00_mma,,I used to work for Shinra. Up until a few years ago.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16200_00_mma,,Was a maintenance guy in a reactor. It's a dangerous job─costs a lotta people their health.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16300_00_mma,,"Cost me mine... I passed out on the job─mako poisoning. But while I was unconscious, I...had this dream."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16400_00_mma,,Saw friends I'd lost. My mom too. They were crying. In pain.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16500_00_mma,,"When I woke up, I quit the company. Started studying planetology."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16600_00_mma,,That dream opened my eyes to what Shinra was doing.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16700_00_mma,,Quitting was the best thing I ever did. It was the right thing to do─for the people I loved.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16800_00_mma,,Blessings of the planet upon you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16900_00_mma,,A wonderful story.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_16900_00_mma,ACTOR,Mentor
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17000_00_mma,,Amazing!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1700_00_mma,,"It has been seventy years since I embarked upon my journey, yet I still have so much to learn."

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17200_00_mma,,"We'd been trying for so long to have a child, but...nothing seemed to be working."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17300_00_mma,,We'd gone through every treatment under the sun. It was...it was tough.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17400_00_mma,,"After years, we started to wonder if something else was going on. Like maybe we'd been cut off from the planet─from its energy."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17600_00_mfa,,"But then we realized that there were other ways to nurture life, besides raising a family."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17700_00_mfa,,"We could plant trees, grow crops, or even help children who had lost their parents."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17800_00_mfa,,All life returns to the planet and is reborn eventually. We could still contribute to the cycle─just not in the way we'd planned.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_17900_00_mfa,,That's why we decided to move here and start fresh. To have an impact.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18000_00_mma,,Blessings of the planet upon you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1800_00_mma,,"Before we are even born, we are travelers. Souls adrift in her currents."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18100_00_mfa,,Blessings of the planet upon you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18500_00_mfa,,"For as long as I can remember, I wanted to return to the planet. In my waking moments and in my dreams, these thoughts were always with me."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18600_00_mfa,,I felt as though no one truly loved me─and never would. That there was no place for me with others─only with her.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18800_00_mfa,,"My parents tried to understand, but they couldn't. That's why they brought me to Cosmo Canyon."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_18900_00_mfa,,But as I lived here and learned more about planetology...my view on things started to change.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19000_00_mfa,,"I realized that, when I do return, the only thing I can take with me are my memories."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_1900_00_mma,,"As the planet nurtures us, we in turn are to nurture the planet. This is our duty."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19100_00_mfa,,And if I want to be happy and at peace when I'm one with her...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19200_00_mfa,,I need to live a full life─experience as much as I can.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19300_00_mfa,,"I want to learn, see, and do more─enjoy everything the world has to offer!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19400_00_mfa,,And I owe this new perspective to everyone here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19500_00_mfa,,Blessings of the planet be upon you all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19600_00_mfa,,I lost my husband. Back in the war with Wutai.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19700_00_mfa,,"In spite of all that pain and suffering, the world looks like it's on the brink of violence again."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19800_00_mfa,,Why do people always have to repeat the mistakes of the past?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_19900_00_mfa,,Humanity has had such a long history and so many chances to learn how futile war and conflict are.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20000_00_mfa,,Nobody knows that better than those we've lost─those who have returned to the planet and rejoined the lifestream.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2000_00_mma,,The planet beneath our feet grants unto us her blessings. We have but to place our faith in her─and ask.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20100_00_mfa,,"If only we would stop and listen to what they have to say, everyone still fighting would realize what war really is: empty and meaningless."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20300_00_mfa,,"When we close our hearts to the voice of the planet, when we refuse to let its words fill our souls with love─that's when we become our own worst enemy."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20500_00_mfa,,Blessings of the planet be upon you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20600_00_mfa,,That was a really moving speech. You did great.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20700_00_mfa,,Come to think of it...you were going through quite the rough patch the first time we met too.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20800_00_mma,,Yeah. I'd have said the hell with it and given up if it weren't for you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20810_00_mma,,Almost feels like the planet wanted us to find each other.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_20900_00_mfa,,Doesn't it? We must have been inseparable even in the lifestream─coursing around the world and mingling together as one.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21000_00_mma,,"All the time I've spent here, listening and learning, has helped me realize what I'm meant to do in this world!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2100_00_mma,,"We must strive to heed the planet's call, lending her our ears, but remember: she too is always listening."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21100_00_mma,,"I should be a force for good. Help folks out, spread positive vibes─that's how I'll protect the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21200_00_mma,,"Like yesterday, I helped this poor old woman carry her groceries! And today, I took out the trash at the bar."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21400_00_mma,,"I've been floating through my life without any purpose, but I've finally found it!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21500_00_mma,,Planetology has made me a better me!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21600_00_mfa,,"Relax, close your eyes, and listen... Listen to the voice of the planet resounding within your very soul."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21700_00_mfa,,"Just as we are a part of the planet, the planet is, in turn, a part of us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21800_00_mfa,,"Let the voice rise up and wash over you, that it may guide your steps on the path to enlightenment."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_21900_00_mfa,,Don't be afraid. Relax and give yourself over to the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22000_00_mfa,,"Now, slowly open your eyes..."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2200_00_mfa,,"Professor Gast often visited the vale. I must say, it was always an honor to receive such an eminent scholar of the Cetra."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22100_00_mfa,,"Did you hear it? Remember: the planet is always speaking, and we need but listen."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22200_00_mfa,,"If we still our hearts and open our ears, all of us can attune ourselves to the planet─and to the wisdom of her words."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22300_00_mfa,,Let us focus once more...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22400_00_mfa,,I think meditation has really helped me attune to the voice of the planet. Everything she says seems so much clearer to me now.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22600_00_mma,,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Lately I've felt like I can make out what animals are saying."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22700_00_mfa,,Uh... What?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22800_00_mma,,"No, seriously! I heard it clear as day, some kinda dog yelling ""I'm back!"""
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_22900_00_mma,,"Through the practice of mindful breathing, we can tap into the flow of the planet's spiritual energy and bring it into ourselves."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2300_00_mfa,,I would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have regarding planetology.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23100_00_mma,,"First, a deep, calming breath through the nose."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23200_00_mma,,Visualize the energy entering into your lungs. Feel it work its way through you─to your fingertips and toes.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23400_00_mma,,"Let it fill your body, then breathe out...that the energy may return to the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23500_00_mma,,Hihhh... Hahhh...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23600_00_mma,,"In the same way oxygen circulates through our bodies in the blood, spiritual energy courses through the planet. It is what allows the world to sustain our many diverse forms of life."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23800_00_mma,,"Through mindful breathing, we are in effect attuning to the natural flow of spiritual energy."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_23900_00_mma,,"And through regular practice, we can experience a union with the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24000_00_mma,,"Focus now on that sense of oneness with our world, and then we will begin again."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2400_00_mfa,,"One must exercise patience in the pursuit of knowledge. For that which we truly need to know, we shall learn in time."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24100_00_mma,,"We will now embark on our tour of the vale, whereby you may all experience the flow of spiritual energy."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24200_00_mma,,"Our journey begins here, at the dawn of life─as newborn souls, freshly birthed by the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24300_00_mma,,"Though the road ahead is unknown, we are not afraid, for we walk with the great mother at our side."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24400_00_mma,,"After receiving the gift of life, we must endure countless sorrows─yet beyond the hardships, happiness awaits."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24500_00_mma,,This is our golden age.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24600_00_mma,,Our tour of the vale thus far has no doubt called to mind many emotions and experiences. Let us take a moment to reflect on them now.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24800_00_mma,,"Through regular spiritual communion, we may all come to live more fulfilling lives."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_24900_00_mma,,"And now, we reach the age of twilight."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25000_00_mma,,"As the sun sinks below the horizon, so too does our knowledge and experience─our very essence─rejoin with the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2500_00_mfa,,I plan to devote the rest of my life to studying planetology. There's no worthier cause.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25100_00_mma,,Yet we need not fear this return.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25200_00_mma,,The memories that survive our flesh are a gift─a legacy to be inherited by future generations of life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25400_00_mma,,"Finally, let us gaze upon the bonfire."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25500_00_mma,,The souls that have returned whence they came merge with the glorious star that burns bright within the heart of our planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25600_00_mma,,And from this blinding brilliance arises a new dawn.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25700_00_mma,,"For the souls that have finished one life receive the blessings of the planet, and in time shall be born again."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25800_00_mma,,This concludes our tour─though our spiritual journey is without end.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25900_00_mma,,"Hm, you must be Nanaki's friends. He's gone up to the observatory, if you're wondering."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_25900_00_mma,ACTOR,Attendant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2600_00_mfa,,"If you attune yourself with the natural flow of the planet, the answers will come."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26200_00_mma,,"I heard from Fellow Bugenhagen. By all means, please come and join the seminar."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26200_00_mma,ACTOR,Attendant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26300_00_mma,,Follow me if you would.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26300_00_mma,ACTOR,Attendant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26400_00_mma,,Please continue on into the assembly.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26400_00_mma,ACTOR,Attendant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26500_00_mfa,,"I'm sorry, but the elevator is currently undergoing maintenance."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_26500_00_mfa,ACTOR,Attendant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2700_00_mfa,,"Just as all things begin with the planet, so too do they end."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2800_00_mfa,,"Every life is born of the planet, and must be afforded love and affection."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_2900_00_mma,,"Already I feel the planet's essence more keenly. Tonight, we shall all be as one with the lifestream."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3000_00_mma,,Souls in waiting are returned to the planet through the River of Lights. It serves as both an ending and a new beginning.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3100_00_mma,,"The bonfire symbolizes the life of the planet, so it's fitting that it should serve as the site for the River of Lights."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3200_00_mfa,,The bond between us and the planet deepens on the night of the River of Lights.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3300_00_mfa,,"The River of Lights is one way we show our gratitude to the planet. Through it, we return her blessing of life."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3400_00_mfa,,"There's also a sister ceremony to the River of Lights, in which the bonfire is extinguished."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3500_00_mma,,"The River of Lights has a long and storied history, which can be traced back as far as the time of the Cetra themselves."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3600_00_mma,,The River of Lights ceremony evokes the cyclical flow of life on the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3700_00_mma,,"Many travelers have joined in the River of Lights as of late, but their interest in our vale ends there."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3800_00_mfa,,"If you wish to deepen your understanding of the planet, you should participate in the River of Lights."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_3900_00_mfa,,"The River of Lights is a sacred ritual, not some tourist attraction."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4000_00_mfa,,"When I was a young girl, I dreamed of one day leading the River of Lights ceremony."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4100_00_mma,,"The hour is late, my friends. Please come again tomorrow morning."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4200_00_mma,,The beauty of the stars grows tenfold on the night we hold the River of Lights.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4300_00_mma,,"There will be a seminar held tomorrow morning, as well."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4400_00_mfa,,I pray that the planet will see fit to guide you true.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4500_00_mfa,,Take care not to leave the town after dark.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4600_00_mfa,,"Oh, are you having trouble sleeping?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4700_00_mma,,"If you were moved by what you witnessed tonight, then you should begin your personal study of planetology."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4800_00_mma,,The planet's grace is all around us. Can you feel it?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_4900_00_mma,,"In time, all will come to know the joy of living in harmony with the planet."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5000_00_mfa,,I hope the River of Lights has given you insight into the tenets of planetology.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5100_00_mfa,,May the seeds of gratitude sown in your heart bloom into true appreciation for our planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5200_00_mfa,,May the planet watch over and keep you safe.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5300_00_mma,,War is the purview of fools ignorant of planetology and its higher truths.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5400_00_mma,,"Come what may, the planet will always watch over and protect its children."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5500_00_mma,,The planet is the arbiter of all things. We have but to heed its will.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5600_00_mma,,"Trust in our mother, from whom all blessings flow."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5700_00_mfa,,I can only imagine how it must pain the planet to watch us wage these wars.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5800_00_mfa,,"Even when we go astray, the planet guides our every step until we return to the path."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_5900_00_mfa,,Why would they choose war? Can't they hear the planet's cries?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6000_00_mfa,,The world needs planetology now more than ever before.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6100_00_mma,,"Our hearts and minds are bound to the planet. When at last we attain inner peace, so too shall our world."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6200_00_mma,,"The further we stray from the light of our great mother, the more lost we become."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6300_00_mma,,We humble students of planetology can do little but endeavor to share the wisdom of our mother with any who will listen.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6400_00_mma,,"Humans are destined to err. And each time we do, we bring harm upon our great mother."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6500_00_mfa,,More and more people are growing deaf to the cries of the planet. I worry for our future.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6600_00_mfa,,"Hatred is but the stagnation of emotion. If the flow is disrupted, the corruption that arises will spread throughout the planet. Like a disease."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6700_00_mfa,,Some have theorized that war is an instrument of the planet's will─a means to cull the ignorant and malicious.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6800_00_mfa,,"Learn all that planetology has to teach us. Do this, and rest assured that you will find salvation."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6900_00_mfa,,Lift your gaze to the heavens.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_6910_00_mfa,,"Watch as the clouds drift through the sky, going whichever way the wind takes them."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7000_00_mma,,"We humans are the same. The planet charts a course for us, and we need only walk it."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7100_00_mfa,,"Quite right. All we need to do is follow its guidance, for one day it will surely lead us to the tranquility we seek."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7200_00_mma,,"Beneath our vale, bound and stagnant..."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7300_00_mma,,Do you have any notion as to why the planet would choose to set such a trial before us?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7400_00_mfa,,I believe it is because she is confident that we have the strength to overcome it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7500_00_mma,,"The fact that we stand here today, alive and well─having overcome our challenges─is proof of this."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7700_00_mma,,"Indeed. As the planet ordains, so it shall be."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7710_00_mma,,This truth is absolute and must never be forgotten.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7800_00_mma,,"We yearn to chase the horizon. Embrace exploration, wheresoever it takes you."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_7900_00_mma,,To drift about─to wander from place to place─that is the essence of life.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8000_00_mfa,,"Then, sir... Will you be embarking on a journey?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8100_00_mma,,"Quite soon, yes."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8200_00_mma,,For our mission is to spread the teachings of planetology to one and all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8300_00_mfa,,"Tell me: is it better to spread the teachings of planetology to others, or to focus on deepening our own understanding?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8400_00_mfa,,"Which, would you say, is a more worthy pursuit?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8500_00_mfa,,"They are both one and the same, wouldn't you agree? We are as much a part of the planet as it is a part of us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8600_00_mfa,,"At one time, there was no distinction...no lines to separate us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8700_00_mfa,,"And so long as we do not stray from our path, one day we shall all return to and rejoin the greater whole."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8800_00_mma,,The seminars all look so interesting!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_8900_00_mma,,I went to a meditation session─cleared my mind right up!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9000_00_mma,,I just learned about mindful breathing at one of the workshops! Hah...fwoo...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9100_00_mma,,"Hey, what time's the next session at again?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9200_00_mma,,Hnng... Maybe I'll chill at the Starlet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9300_00_mma,,It's so great learning about planetology with everyone!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9400_00_mma,,I bet the planet's speaking to us right now. All we have to do is listen!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9500_00_mfa,,"I joined a seminar earlier, but the mentor running it was so hot, I couldn't focus."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9600_00_mfa,,I need to rest my brain at the hotel before the next seminar.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9700_00_mfa,,Try the inhalation seminar. It's breathtaking!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9800_00_mfa,,Wicked thoughts begone! Good vibes only!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0400_9900_00_mfa,,So many seminars... Where do I even start?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0100_00_mma,,"A warm welcome to you, friends of Nanaki."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0200_00_mma,,Here we seek to gather the wisdom of the planet.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0300_00_mma,,Working here is an incredible honor.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0400_00_mma,,Nothing is as beautifully complex as the cosmos.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0500_00_mma,,There is so much we have yet to learn about the universe.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0600_00_mfa,,We have Professor Gast to thank for a full half of the research materials archived here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0700_00_mfa,,The stars have taught us countless lessons over the years.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0800_00_mfa,,"We've all been worried sick about Nanaki, Fellow Bugenhagen chiefly among us."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_0900_00_mfa,,Mind your manners in front of Fellow Bugenhagen.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1000_00_mfa,,"The planet connects us, one and all. For everything exists through her."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1100_00_mma,,Shinra's about to commit some more grave mistakes.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1200_00_mma,,We need to move our records to a safe location before war breaks out.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1300_00_mma,,I wonder if it's just our nature to wage war with one another.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1400_00_mfa,,War─and the planet's will regarding it─is the subject of my research.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1500_00_mfa,,Nothing is a greater waste of spiritual energy than war.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1600_00_mfa,,"While they aren't an exact match, we have records of several organizations resembling the SRC."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_1700_00_mma,,"Not so fast. Sorry, but visitors aren't allowed in here."

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2010_00_mma,,Fellow Bugenhagen instructed me to let you take anything you think might prove useful on your journey.

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2020_00_mma,,Check out the storeroom when you have a chance.

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2300_00_mfa,ACTOR,Assistant
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2310_00_mfa,,Blessings of the planet upon you.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2400_00_mfa,,The lights we observe here have traveled to us from the far reaches of time and space.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2500_00_mfa,,"To gaze at the stars is to gaze into their past─what they once were, eons ago."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2600_00_mma,,Can't say I'm all that interested in the future.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2700_00_mma,,But that's just how we're wired. Humans can't help but fixate on the past─on what used to be.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2800_00_mma,,"I never thought you could become even more enchanting, and yet... It's like you're singing to me of the planet's wisdom."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0500_2900_00_mma,,"Don't you worry, my dear. I'll find a way to bring out the full depths of your beauty. Cross my heart."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0100_00_mma,,"Sacred though it is, be sure not to wander too close to the bonfire."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0200_00_mma,,Please continue to watch over and protect the canyon.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0300_00_mma,,The bonfire is the heart of Cosmo Canyon.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0400_00_mfa,,That flame has been burning since long before I was born. Kind of crazy to think about...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0500_00_mfa,,There's something strangely enchanting about this fire.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0600_00_mfa,,Please keep your voice down here.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0700_00_mma,,May the planet guide you home.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0800_00_mma,,May these souls find peace within her embrace.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_0900_00_mma,,May your journey home be straight and swift.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1000_00_mma,,I pray these souls do not lose their way.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1100_00_mfa,,May the planet guide you home.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1200_00_mfa,,O sacred Flame... Protect these souls as they travel home.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1300_00_mfa,,May your journey home be straight and swift.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1400_00_mfa,,May the planet embrace you...
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1500_00_mfa,,"The Torch of Cosmo Canyon was first lit long ago, when the vale itself was born."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1600_00_mfa,,"Its flames ever burn─they do not falter on the rainiest of days, nor when the wind blows fierce and relentless."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1700_00_mfa,,This balefire is the very life of the planet itself.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1710_00_mfa,,To stand vigil as one of its guardians is a sacred duty that I embrace.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1800_00_mfa,,"It is but once every fifty years, on a day when all grows still, that the fires fade."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_1900_00_mfa,,"Just as we who live upon it, the planet has been reborn countless times─as ever it will be."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2000_00_mma,,"Some carry a fire that rivals even this. Like the youths who left the vale years ago. Avalanche, they called themselves."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2200_00_mma,,"They were young, but the desire to protect the planet burned bright within their hearts."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2300_00_mma,,And who were we to quench such noble passions?
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2400_00_mma,,"Though their path led them elsewhere, if they ever find their way back home, I hope to be here. To welcome them with open arms. No matter what they have done."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2600_00_mfa,,"O great mother, from whom all blessings flow!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2610_00_mfa,,We beseech you─cast your light in the dark and lead your children!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2700_00_mfa,,"Tonight, they return home from their long journey. Welcome them, O mother, with love and grace."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2800_00_mma,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_2900_00_mma,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3000_00_mma,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3100_00_mfa,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3200_00_mfa,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3300_00_mfa,,May the planet guide us all.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3400_00_mfa,,"Aerith is so courageous, sharing her truth with us! Such character!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3500_00_mfa,,May we all be graced with the planet's wisdom and guidance!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3600_00_mma,,I commend you for choosing to participate in this evening's ceremony.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3700_00_mma,,"All of us here are friends to Aerith, I promise you."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3800_00_mma,,Aerith sharing her story made this evening truly special.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_3900_00_mma,,"For better or for worse, this world is a far cry from that in which the Cetra once lived."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4000_00_mfa,,My heart goes out to Aerith. I can only imagine the hardship she must have faced.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4100_00_mfa,,I pray that the planet watches over and keeps all of you from harm on your journey.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4200_00_mfa,,I'm glad to know that Aerith has friends like you to keep her company.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4300_00_mfa,,Today's experience was surely the will of the planet. May you cherish it always.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4400_00_mma,,You're fine just the way you are!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4500_00_mma,,"Don't let 'em get ya down, y'hear?"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4600_00_mma,,Know that we'll always support you!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4700_00_mfa,,"Miss, that was just so, so moving!"
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4800_00_mfa,,Thank you so much for sharing your story.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_4900_00_mfa,,I want you to know I'm rooting for you!
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0600_5000_00_mma,,I'm afraid I can't let you past.

$CSMOC_NPC_10_0700_0200_00_mma,,"Back in the day, this used to be where folks started their pilgrimage to Cosmo Canyon."
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0700_0300_00_mfa,,It was the planet's will that led you here. I'm sure of it.
$CSMOC_NPC_10_0700_0400_00_mfa,,People say that lost souls have been drawn to this place for as long as anyone can remember.
